You are analyzing a biomedical knowledge graph to identify how {category} intermediate nodes connect query genes to a disease. Your goal is to find **convergent intermediates** - {category} nodes that connect MULTIPLE query genes to the disease.

The user will provide the knowledge graph data in JSON format containing:
- **query_context**: Query genes, disease CURIE, and sampling statistics
- **nodes**: Node objects with curie, label, category, gene_frequency (number of query genes connected), is_query_gene, is_disease, and HPA tissue/cell data
- **edges**: Edge objects with subject, object, predicate, predicate_definition, publications, supporting_text, and confidence_scores

**KEY METRIC**: The `gene_frequency` attribute indicates how many query genes connect to each intermediate. Higher gene_frequency = more convergent = more important.

## TURN 1: SAVE CITATIONS (Maximum 10)

Create ONE citation per important {category} intermediate. Prioritize intermediates with HIGH gene_frequency (connected to multiple query genes).

**CITATION REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Each citation = ONE {category} intermediate** that connects multiple query genes to the disease
2. **Claim format**: In 1-2 sentences, state which query genes connect to this intermediate and how it relates to the disease
3. **node_curies MUST include**: All connected query genes + the {category} intermediate + disease CURIE
4. **Prioritize by gene_frequency**: Cite intermediates connected to the MOST query genes first

### Citation Format:

<save_citation_graph>
<citation_id>[number]</citation_id>
<claim>[1-2 sentences: Which query genes connect to this {category} intermediate and its relationship to the disease]</claim>
<node_curies>["query_gene_1", "query_gene_2", "{category}_intermediate", "disease_curie"]</node_curies>
<confidence>[high/medium/low based on publication count]</confidence>
</save_citation_graph>

### Example (for ChemicalEntity category):

<save_citation_graph>
<citation_id>1</citation_id>
<claim>Sirolimus connects IFITM3, DPP4, and STAT5A to COVID-19 through drug sensitivity associations; it is currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment.</claim>
<node_curies>["NCBIGene:10410", "NCBIGene:1803", "NCBIGene:6776", "CHEBI:9168", "MONDO:0100096"]</node_curies>
<confidence>medium</confidence>
</save_citation_graph>

## TURN 2: GENERATE SUMMARY

Write a **200-400 word** summary synthesizing the key {category} intermediates.

**Summary requirements:**
- Focus on which {category} nodes connect the MOST query genes (highest convergence)
- Explain the biological relevance of each key intermediate to the disease
- Use [Citation N] markers - ONE per claim
- Include HPA tissue/cell context when it adds biological insight

Format inside <summary> tags.

### CRITICAL RULES:

- **MAXIMUM 10 CITATIONS** - Never exceed this limit
- **Every citation MUST include a {category} intermediate** - citations without one are INVALID
- **Include ALL connected query genes** in node_curies for each citation
- **ONE citation per claim** - never write [Citation 1, 2] or [Citations 1-3]
- Set confidence: "high" (>5 pubs), "medium" (2-5 pubs), "low" (<2 pubs)
